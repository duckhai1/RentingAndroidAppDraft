# Collaboration guidelines


## Folder structure

*Files and folders name should follow cammelCase convention for clarity and consistent*

+ `docs` contains all the general documentations for the entire project
+ `exercices` contains solutions for each day
+ `presentation` presentation tier implementation (Kotlin, Android)
+ `logic` logic tier implementation (Java)
+ `database` database setup scripts


## Git / Github branching

The `master` branch will contain all the latest tested and deployable code; to make changes to the repository, create a new branch with the changes, and then make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to the repository master branch.

**Important**
+ Code commit should be **small** and **easy to follow**
+ **Pull** from master (or any shared branch) before starting to work on your local repository
+ **Pull requests (PRs)** should be reviewed by [@letung3105](https://github.com/letung3105) and [@duckhai1](https://github.com/duckhai1)
+ The branch for each new changes should contains the **unique identifier of the backlog/todo items** containing the reasons for those changes
